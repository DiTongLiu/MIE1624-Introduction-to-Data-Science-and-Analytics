This means that the model predicted the correct sentiment on just over half the tweets in the elections dataset. This same model has an accuracy of 95.25% when used to predict sentiment in sentiment_analysis dataset, meaning that there was a big drop in accuracy when the test set was switched from sentiment_analysis to the elections dataset."

    "Q: Discuss whether NLP analytics based on tweets is useful for political parties during election campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: I believe that natural language processing is very useful for political parties during election campaigns. First of all, political parties can use NLP to predict the public's overall sentiment of their political opponents (opposing parties). From this, the political party can get a general idea of where they stand in terms of the general public (e.g. if a party's sentiment is better than the sentiment of the opposition, it means that the party is likely to win the election). Political parties can also use NLP analytics obtained from tweets to make important election campaign decisions. For example, since twitter users can be traced by the geographical location (hometown) that they set in their profile, political parties can use these analytics to determine which regions/ geographical areas have an overall negative sentiment of the party. The political party can then decide to invest more time and resources to hold additional campaigns in these regions to try and improve this sentiment. This is especially important in the \"swing states\" during US elections, since these states are often very hard to predict."

    "My first model, multinomial Naive Bayes using TF-IDF features, was found to be the best model for predicting the sentiment of tweets. This model was trained on the training set of the sentiment_analysis dataset. The model had an accuracy of 95.56% when tested on the test set of sentiment_analysis, which was the highest out of all the models I implemented. However, when I used this same model (trained on sentiment_analysis training set) to predict the sentiment of the Canadian_elections_2019 dataset, it was only able to achieve an accuracy of 51%. I believe that the main reason for this large drop in accuracy is most likely due to my model being slightly overfitted on the sentiment_analysis dataset.\n",

In contrast, the true sentiment of the New Democratic Party is mostly positive. My model, however, predicted all three political parties to have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment. The true sentiment of the political parties tells us that in the public has mainly negative views on the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party, and has mainly positive views for the New Democratic Party."

    "My second model, gradient boosted trees using TF-IDF features with a 0.01 learning rate, was found to be the best model for predicting the reason for negative tweets in the elections dataset. When used on the test set, this model had an accuracy of 53.64%. I believe that there are two main reasons as to why my model may have failed to correctly predict some of the negative reasons of the tweets. The first reason is that some of the negative reasons are very similar to each other. For example, \"scandal\" and \"tell lies\" are very similar to each other, which means that tweets under these two reasons most likely share a lot of key words. To back up my claim, if we look at the test set, we can see that tweet 22 is classified as \"scandal\" and tweet 105 is classified as \"tell lies\", however both of these tweets have the word \"disinformation\" in them. These similarities amongst different target classes may have introduced unnecessary bias into the classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason is the presence of the \"Others\" category in the target class (negative reasons). This category is not a single negative reason, but is actually all of the reasons not listed combined into one. Furthermore, if we look at the test set, this \"others\" category is by far the biggest target class out of all of the negative reasons, with a total of 365 tweets in this category. In terms of natural language processing, this can impact the performance of the classification model by introducing unnecessary variance into the data, since tweets in this class will most likely have a very wide variety of different words amongst them."

    "\n",
    "One way that I can improve my first model (predicting sentiment) is to account for the order of the words in the tweets. Having the machine learning model learn the syntactic information of the tweets will most definitely improve accuracy. A common way to do this is to treat each tweet as a sequence of individual word vectors and train it through a convolutional neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to improve my second model (predicting negative sentiment reason) would be to increase the maximum features of my TF-IDF vectorizer. Having more features means that the machine learning model will be able to train using a wider variety of words, which will most likely improve the accuracy of the model. Different classes having similar words between each other will not be as big of an issue anymore if number of features are increased, since there are more words for the model to train on."
